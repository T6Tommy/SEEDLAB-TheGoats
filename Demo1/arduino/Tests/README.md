These 2 programs are used to initially get the robot to spin (Tester) and to move forward (Tester2).

The Arduino Uno must be connected to the 2 motors that spin the wheels, pins 2 & 11 for the left encoder, pins 3 & 5 for the right encoder, the battery, and the battery controller.

These 2 files are used to figure out the functonality of spinning and going forward on the robot. This is the initial rendetion of our Demo code.
