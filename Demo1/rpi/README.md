### Raspberry Pi: Python Code

In this folder, "rpi", there are two sets of Python code used on the Raspberry Pi.

The first code is labeled, "Demo1.py". This Python code is the marker detection scheme used with the Pi Camera to detect the 1" blue tape marker.
This Python code also detects the horizontal angle of the 1" blue tape marker to the camera.

The second code is labeled, "i2c.py". This Python code takes in the horizontal angle in radians sent by the "Demo1.py".
It interprets this data to send to the LCD display.
