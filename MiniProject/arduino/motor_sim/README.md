Motor Simulation - Mini Project
Team 7 - The Goats
Spring 2022

This file was created to obtain a transfer function for the simulation of the mototr.
The required setup for this code to work:
- A Pololu Dual MC33926 Motor Driver Shield that is plugged into an Arduino Uno & a battery.
- A motor that is hooked up to the driver shield, and that has its encoder pins attached to 
    5V, GND, and PINS 3&5.

After this program was run, we took the data from the Serial and imported it into MATLAB so 
  that we could run our TFexp code to obtaing the transfer function values.
