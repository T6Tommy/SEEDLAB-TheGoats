### Raspberry Pi: Python Code

In this folder, "rpi", there are two sets of Python code used on the Raspberry Pi.

The first code is labeled, "MP1.py". This Python code is the marker detection scheme used with the Pi Camera to detect a marker of a certain color.
For this mini project, the marker color is set to blue for blue masking tape.

The second code is labeled, "ic2.py".
